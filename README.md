# CDISC / Transcelerate DDF USDM Package

This package provides an implementation of the Digital Data Flow (DDF) CDISC / TransCelerate Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Two main parts are provided:

- Within the `usdm_model` directory are a set of classes reflecting the USDM model as transported using the DDF USDM API 
- Within the `usdm_excel` directory is a class, `USDMExcel`, that can be used to import an entire study definition from an excel file and build the equivalent json as defined by the API

# Warning

This package was, originally, not intended for public use and, consequently, only informal testing has been performed on the package to date. Formal testing has just begun. Use this at your own risk.

# Setup

Setup is via pip

`pip install usdm`

The package requires a single environment variable `CDISC_API_KEY` that should be set to your CDISC library API key. This is used to access CDISC CT and BC definitions in the CDISC library.

See below for a simple example program.

# USDM Model

Not further information as yet.

# Excel Import

## Example Program

The following code imports an Excel file (in the appropriate structure) and processes it. The data are then exported to a file in JSON API format. *Note: The logging is not needed.*

```
import logging
log = logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import json
from usdm_excel import USDMExcel

excel = USDMExcel("source_data/simple_1.xlsx")
with open('source_data/simple_1.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  f.write(json.dumps(json.loads(excel.to_json()), indent=2))
```

## Format of Workbook

### Example

An example spreadsheet in maintained within the [document directory](https://github.com/data4knowledge/usdm/tree/main/docs).

### Sheets

The workbook consists of several sheets each with a dedicated purpose. All sheets must be present except for those marked optional.

- Study sheet
- Study Identifiers sheet
- Study Amendments sheet
- Study Design sheet
- One or more Timeline sheets
- Study Design Timing sheet
- Study Design Activities sheet (optional)
- Study Design Indications sheet
- Study Design Interventions sheet
- Study Design Populations sheet
- Study Design Characteristcis sheet
- Study Design Objectives and Endpoints sheet
- Study Design Eligibility Criteria sheet
- Study Design Estimands sheet
- Study Design Procedures sheet
- Study Design Encounters sheet
- Study Design Elements sheet
- Study Design Content sheet
- Study Design Sites sheet (optional)
- Dictionaries Sheet
- Configuration sheet

The content of each sheet is described below. 

### CDISC Terminology

For those cells where CDISC codes are used the user can enter either the CDISC C Code, for example `C15602`, the CDISC submission value, for example `PHASE III TRIAL`, or the preferred term, for example `Phase III Trial`

### Multiple Values

Some cells allow for multiple values. These are all comma separated. If users wish to include a comma within such strings then the string can be enclosed in quotes. For example `123, "123,456", 789`.

### External Terminology

For those cells where external CT is referenced the user can enter code in the form `<code system>: <code> = <decode>`. For example `SPONSOR: A = decode 1, SPONSOR: B = decode 2`. Where multiple codes are needed then the values are separated by commas.

### Boolean Values

For boolean fields the following can be used to indicate a `true` value `'Y', 'YES', 'T', 'TRUE', '1'` or the lower case equivalents.

### Address Values

An address is of the form: ```line,district,city,state,postal_code,<country code>```. All fields are text strings except for `<country code>`. `<country code>` is either a two or three character ISO-3166 country code. Note that `|` can be used in place of the commas for backward compatibility.

### Identifiers and Cross References

Some content defined within the sheets contain unique identifiers such that the content can be cross referenced in other sheets. This is done so as to link content or expand definitions. Identifiers are simple strings that need to be unique within the workbook. There is a single definition and one or more cross references.

See the [infographic](https://github.com/data4knowledge/usdm/blob/main/docs/sheets.png) for further information.

### Timing Values

A number of fields specify timing values, either single relative values or ranges. These can be entered as
a *Timing Value* of ```<value> <unit>``` or a *Timing Range* of ```<lower>..<upper> <unit>```. The unit can be entered as follows:

- Years: 'Y', 'YRS', 'YR', 'YEARS', 'YEAR'
- Months: 'MTHS', 'MTH', 'MONTHS', 'MONTH'
- Weeks: 'W', 'WKS', 'WK', 'WEEKS', 'WEEK'
- Days: 'D', 'DYS', 'DY', 'DAYS', 'DAY'
- Hours: 'H', 'HRS', 'HR', 'HOURS', 'HOUR'
- Minutes: 'M', 'MINS', 'MIN', 'MINUTES', 'MINUTE'
- Seconds: 'S', 'SECS', 'SEC', 'SECONDS', 'SECOND'

So ```3 Y```, ```3 YRS```, ```3 YR```, ```3 YEARS```, ```3 YEAR``` are all equivalent. Only a single value and unit should be entered, i.e. combination values are not supported.

### Templated Text

Some entries can include "tags" that allow the text to reference structured content from elsewhere in the model. An example is an eligibility criterion referring to population definitions or an activity name. These sections of text are formatted as `<usdm:tag name="...tag_name..."/>` within the text. The `...tag_name...` refers to an entry within a dictionary (see the dictionaries sheet)

An example of Templated Text is `Subjects shall be between <usdm:tag name="min_age"/> and <usdm:tag name="max_age"/>` where the min and max ages will be inserted using the dictionary entries that refer to particular attribute values from within the structured parts of the model.

### Sheet Descriptions

The sheet descriptions detail the fields found within each sheet and the details of the data required. Note:

- Some fields have multiple names due to model changes and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility. Any of the choices documented can be used. 
- Some columns are optional and thus can be included or omitted. Again this is to preserve backwards compatibility. A default value is specified if the column is not included.

There are some prefined macros that can be used to generate content. These are pre processed when the content sheet is read and transated into the appropriate USDM references ```usdm:ref``` or ```usdm:tag```. These macros use a similar syntax to the USDM references: 

```<usdm:macro id="macro name" attrib1="data1" attrib2="data2" .../>```

| Macro Name | Purpose | Attributes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| xref | Refer to a data element by name reference | 'klass', 'name' and 'attribute'. The name is the name used within the workbook to define the content. |
| image | Insert an mage into the document | 'file' and 'type'. The file attribute specifies the name of a file in the same directory as the Excel workbook. |
| element | Refer to a predefined element | 'name' of the element. Supported element names are 'study_phase', 'study_short_title', 'study_full_title', 'study_acronym', 'study_rationale', 'study_version_identifier', 'study_identifier', 'study_regulatory_identifiers', 'study_date', 'approval_date', 'organization_name_and_address', 'amendment' and 'amendment_scope' |
| section | Add a pre defined section into the document | 'name' and 'template'. Supported section are 'title_page', 'inclusion', 'exclusion' and 'objective_endpoints'. Supported templates are 'm11' and 'plain' |
| bc | Add in a reference to a BC | 'name' and 'activity' where the name is the name of the BC as used in the SoA and activity is the name of the activity it is referenced from (in case several activities reference the same BC). This macro is needed as the BCs are not explicitly defined and thus named, they are read from the CDISC library and can appear multiple times. |
| note | Insert a note into the document | 'text' |

Examples of macros are:

```<usdm:macro id="xref" klass="Objective" name="OBJ1" attribute="text"/>```

```<usdm:macro id="xref" klass="StudyDesignPopulation" name="STUDY_POP" attribute="@plannedCompletionNumber/Range/maxValue"/>```

```<usdm:macro id="element" name="study_identifier"/>```

```<usdm:macro id="image" file="design.png" type="png"/>```

```<usdm:macro id="section" name="inclusion" template="plain"/>```

```<usdm:macro id="bc" name="Body temperature" activity="Vital signs / Temperature">```

```<usdm:macro id="note" text="A note here please"/>```

### Study Design Sites sheet

#### Sheet Name

`studyDesignSites`

#### Sheet Contents

A header row in row 1 followed by repeating rows from row 2, containing organizations and associated sites. Note that columns G through I can repeat for the same content in columns A to F. For additional site rows leave columns A to F blank.

| Column | Column Name | Purpose | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | name | Organization name | Text string |
| B | label | Organization display label | Text string, can be empty |
| C | type | Organisation type | CDISC code reference |
| D | identifierScheme | The scheme for the organisation identifier | Example would be 'DUNS' |
| E | identifier | Organisation identifier | Text string |
| F | address | Organisation address | Address |
| G | siteName | Site name | Formated using a pipe delimited form, see below |
| H | siteDescription | Site description | Text string, can be empty|
| I | siteLabel | Site display Label | Text string, can be empty |

### Study Design Conditions sheet

#### Sheet Name

`studyDesignConditions`

#### Sheet Contents

A header row in row 1 followed by repeating rows from row 2, containing the conditions: 

| Column | Column Name | Purpose | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | name | Condition name | Text string |
| B | label | Condition display label | Text string, can be empty |
| C | description | Condition description | CDISC code reference |
| D | text | The condition text | Text string |
| E | appliesTo | List of cross references for items to which the condition applies | Comms separated list |
| F | context | List of cross references for the context in which the condition applies | Comma separated list |

### Dictionary Sheet

#### Sheet Name

`dictionaries`

#### Sheet Contents

A header row in row 1 followed by repeating rows from row 2. Each row contains a dictionary and dictionary entry definitions. The sheet defines one or more dictionaries and the entries within each dictionary. Note that columns D through F can repeat for the same content in columns A to C. For additional dictionary entry rows leave columns A to C blank.

| Column | Column Name | Purpose | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | name | The dictionary name | Text string | 
| B | description | Description | Text string. Can be empty |	
| C | label | Label | Text string. Can be empty |	
| D | key | The entry key | Text String. Must be unique within the dictionary |
| E | class | The class name | The name of the class within the model from which the data for the dictionary entry is to be taken |
| F | xref | Cross reference name | The name of the instance from which the data is to be taken. Use the entries in the name columns from other sheets |
| G | atrribute | The attribute path or name | The name or path of the attribute from which the data is to be taken |
| H (optonal) | value | The value | A fixed value. If this column is used then the 'class', 'xref' and 'attribute' fields should be empty |

The attribute path follows a simplified 'Xpath' syntax of ```@attribute-name[/class/@attribute-name]``` form. The class attribute pairs can be repeated to arrive as the desired attribute. This has been provided since not all instances of all classes are named which prevents thenm being addressed directly, for example Range of Quantity instances.

An example for accessing the Population planned age, max value is ```@plannedAge/Range/@maxValue```. In this instance the ```class``` column would be set to ```Population``` and the ```xref``` column set to the name of the Population entry in the population shseet. 

Note that the '@' symbol does not need to be included with attribute names but it guides the eye making it easier to read the path.

### Configuration Sheet

#### Sheet Name

`configuration`

#### Sheet Contents

A set of rows consisting of configuration parameters. The first column is the type of configuration parameter while the second is the value. The values for specific parameters may vary in their format

| Parameter | Description | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CT Version | Allows for the version of a specific external CT to be set. Multiple rows can be included to set the versions for several CTs | Of the form ctName = Version, for example `SNOMED = 21st June 2012`|
| Empty None | Allows for string fields to be set to '' rather than null/none values so as to accomodate the SDR validation checks | Set to 'EMPTY' to use ''. Any other value will permit  null values to be used |
| Template | Configures a protocol template and the associated studyDesignContent sheet | Entries take the form of templateName = sheetName, for example `Sponsor = sponsorContent`. The template name and the sheet name are simple strings. Template names are at the user's discretion but the string `m11` or `M11` is reserved as the template name for the M11 Template format. The sheet name must match a sheet within the workbook that must be structured as per the studyDesignContent sheet format. |
| Use Template | Indicates which template is to be used | The value should match one of the names defined using the Template configuration parameter |
| USDM Version | Deprecated | Deprecated |
| SDR Prev Next | Deprecated | Deprecated |
| SDR Root | Deprecated | Deprecated |
| SDR Description | Deprecated | Deprecated |

An example configuration is

| First Column | Second Column |
| :--- | :--- | 
| CT Version | SNOMED=January 31, 2018 |
| CT Version | SPONSOR =   12 |
| CT Version | ICD-10=1 |
| Template | lilly=lillyFormat |
| Template | m11=m11Format |
| Use Template | m11 |

This sets up three CT versions and two templates. The M11 template will be used.
